# Setup Apache Bash Script

This repository contains a bash script I created to automate the setup and configuration of the Apache web server. Through this project, I learned how to simplify the process of installing Apache, configuring virtual hosts, setting up necessary permissions, and ensuring the server runs correctly. This script is perfect for anyone looking to quickly deploy an Apache server with minimal manual intervention.

## Features
- Automated Apache installation
- Virtual host configuration
- Permission setup
- HTTPS configuration
- Client-side caching
- Load Balancing

## Usage
Pre-requisite: Please download a static package from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/)

To use the script, simply run it with the appropriate permissions:
```bash
sudo ./setup_apache.sh
```

Make sure you have the necessary privileges to execute the script and make changes to your system configuration.

## Requirements
- Bash shell
- Root or sudo privileges
