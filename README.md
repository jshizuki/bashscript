# Setup Apache Bash Script

This repository contains a bash script I created to automate the setup and configuration of the Apache web server. Through this project, I learned how to simplify the process of installing Apache, configuring virtual hosts, setting up necessary permissions, and ensuring the server runs correctly. This script is perfect for anyone looking to quickly deploy an Apache server with minimal manual intervention.

## Features
- Automated Apache installation
- Permission setup (basic auth)
- Custom error page configuration
- Virtual host configuration for multi-site hosting
- HTTPS configuration
- Client-side caching
- Load Balancing

## Requirements
- Please download a static package from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/)
- Bash shell
- Root or sudo privileges

## Accessing the Setup

You can access the configured sites using the following URLs:

### Basic Auth, Multi-Site Hosting & Custom Error Page
- [http://site1.localhost:8080](http://site1.localhost:8080)
- [http://site2.localhost:8080](http://site2.localhost:8080)

### HTTPS
- [https://site1.localhost:8443](https://site1.localhost:8443)

### Client-Side Caching
- [http://site3.localhost:8080](http://site3.localhost:8080)

### Load Balancing
- [http://loadbalancer.localhost:8080](http://loadbalancer.localhost:8080)
